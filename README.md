# Snap-Port 🚀

**Snap-Port** is a zero-dependency **TypeScript** library designed to automate the display of GitHub projects on personal websites or portfolios.

The core philosophy is to use GitHub as your **Single Source of Truth**: by simply tagging your repositories, the library handles fetching, processing, caching, and rendering data, eliminating manual updates to your portfolio's code.

---

## 🛠 Technical Features

### 1. Project Selection & Stack Control
Snap-Port offers full control over what is displayed and how technologies are categorized:

- **Discovery Tag**: By default, the library looks for repositories tagged with `port`, but you can define any custom tag during initialization.
- **Stack Filters (Topics)**: For automatic filters and search to work correctly, list your technologies (e.g., `react`, `nodejs`, `css`) in your GitHub repository topics.
- **Why avoid automatic "Language"?**: Snap-Port ignores the default GitHub `language` field to let you highlight the actual stack. This prevents a React project from being labeled merely as "HTML" or "JavaScript" due to build files, ensuring the filter reflects the real project stack.

### 2. Intelligent Image Management
Since the GitHub API does not return direct preview image links, Snap-Port implements an **automatic generation logic**:

To ensure each project has its own image, follow these rules:
- **Preview File**: Create a file named `preview.png` in the root of your repository.
- **Note**: The filename must be exactly `preview.png` (case-sensitive).

If the file is missing or a loading error occurs (such as Rate Limits), the library executes a **cascading fallback strategy**:
1. **GitHub Open Graph**: Attempts to load the dynamic social card generated by GitHub.
2. **Safety Placeholder**: If the request is blocked, it generates a neutral card with the project name via `placehold.co`.

### 3. Integrated UI Components
- **Search Bar**: Real-time text filtering (name, description, and topics).
- **Filter Carousel**: Dynamic carousel based on repository topics.
- **Project Cards (16:9 Layout)**: Responsive cards with technology badges and action buttons (Code and Deploy).

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- **Image Aspect Ratio**: To avoid cropping, save your `preview.png` files in **16:9** aspect ratio (e.g., 1280x720px).
- **Live Demo (Deploy)**: The "Acessar" (Visit) button only appears if the **"Homepage"** field is filled in your GitHub repository settings.

## 📦 Installation & Integration

### Via NPM
```bash
npm install snapport
```

### Via CDN (Direct HTML)
Use ``type="module"`` for modern ES module compatibility.

```html
<!-- 1. Library Styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net">

<!-- 2. Logic and Initialization -->
<script type="module">
  import { initPortfolio } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net';

  initPortfolio('your-username', {
    tag: 'port',                      // Optional: defaults to 'port'
    searchContainer: 'id-search',     // Search container ID
    filtersContainer: 'id-filters',   // Filters container ID
    projectsContainer: 'id-projects'  // Projects grid container ID
  });
</script>
```

---

## 🎨 Customization (CSS Variables)
Adapt the UI to your theme by overriding these variables in your global CSS:

```css
:root {
  --ghp-accent: #333;           /* Accent color (buttons/icons) */
  --ghp-bg: #ffffff;            /* Card background */
  --ghp-text: #333;             /* Main headings and text */
  --ghp-text-light: #666;       /* Descriptions and secondary text */
  --ghp-border: rgba(226, 226, 228, 0.8); /* Borders */
  --ghp-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);       /* Card shadows */
}
```

## ⚙️ Performance & Advanced Usage

### Custom Template Injection
Keep the search/cache logic but use your own design:

```javascript
initPortfolio('your-username', {
  projectsContainer: 'id-projects',
  customCardTemplate: (repo) => `
    <div class="my-custom-card">
      <h4>${repo.name}</h4>
      <p>${repo.description}</p>
      <a href="${repo.htmlUrl}">View Source</a>
    </div>
  `
});
```

### Cache & Stability
Data is stored via localStorage for better performance:

- Persistence: Data cached for up to 2 hours.
- Isolation: Cache is separated by GitHub username.
